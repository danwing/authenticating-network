                  Authenticating a Network Connection
                draft-wing-authenticating-network-latest

Abstract

   When connecting to a wired or wireless network, users assume the same
   network exists each time.  This document describes how a network
   client can verify it is, in fact, connecting to the same network,
   without relying on layer 1 or layer 2 security.

1.  Introduction

   When a client connects to a network -- wired or wireless -- the user
   or their device want to be sure the connection is to the expected
   network, as different networks provides different services --
   performance, security, access to split-horizon DNS servers, and so
   on.  Although 802.1X provides layer 2 security for both Ethernet and
   WiFi networks achieving the goals of this document, 802.1X is not
   widely deployed and unavailable on LTE and 5G networks.

   On wired networks a malicious actor or innocent cabling or VLAN
   configuration mistakes can cause the same physical Ethernet jack to
   connect to a different network.  On WiFi networks a malicious actor
   can operate a rogue access point with the same SSID and WPA-PSK as
   the victim network [Evil-Twin].

   This document describes how a wired or wireless client can utilize
   network-advertised encrypted DNS servers to verify initial connection
   to the intended network and automatically verify re-connection to the
   same intended network.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Procedure

   Client connects to network and obtains network information via
   DHCPv4, DHCPv6, RA, or 3GPP mechanism.  The network indicates its
   encrypted DNS server using either [DNR] or [DDR].  The client
   connects to that encrypted DNS server, completes the TLS handshake
   and performs public key validation of the presented certificate.

      todo: need name of, and citation to, the 3gpp mechanism.

   As a wired network has no 'name', the network name can be considered
   blank.  This isn't ideal, but it still allows the client to
   distinguish between the first connection to a network versus re-
   connecting to a network.

   The client device's imprecise location (if known) and the WiFi
   network name (SSID) can be associated with the encrypted DNS server's
   SubjectAltName that was learned via [DNR] or [DDR].

   If this is the first time connecting to that encrypted DNS server's
   identity, an action can be performed such as prompting the user for
   verification, verifying the encrypted DNS server's certificate with
   the fingerprint provided in an extended WiFi QR code (Appendix A),
   consulting a crowd-sourced database, or -- perhaps best -- using a
   matching SSID and SubjectAltName described in Section 4.  After this
   step, the relationship of location, WiFi network name, and
   SubjectAltName are stored on the client.

   If this is not the first time connecting to this same SSID, the
   client location, WiFi network name, and SubjectAltName should all
   match for this re-connection.  If the SubjectAltName differs, this
   indicates a different network than expected -- either a different
   network

      todo: if a network advertises 8.8.8.8 via DNR or DDR, we can't
      detect an evil twin.  How do we identify 8.8.8.8 as a public DNS
      server?  Could we say the network-advertise encrypted DNS server
      has to be on the same network (RFC1918 space or same /64) as the
      client obtained??  But that seems somewhat constraining.  Another
      idea is "if you've seen this same certificate via another SSID",
      but that doesn't work well, either: for example, I have a single
      DNS server in my house for all of my various SSIDs (guest, IoT,
      home network, work network).  Hmm.  Need more ideas.

4.  Avoiding Trust on First Use

   Trust on First Use can be avoided if the SSID name and DNS server's
   Subject Alt Name match.  Unfortunately such a constraint disallows
   vanity SSID names.  Also, social engineering attacks gain additional
   information if the network's physical address (123-Main-
   Street.example.net) or name (John-Jones.example.net) is included as
   part of the SSID.  Thus the only safe SSID name provides no
   information to assist social engineering attacks such as a customer
   number (customer-123.example.net), assuming the customer number can
   safely be disclosed to neighbors.

5.  Common WiFi Names

   (( probably want to delete this section ))

   Some WiFi names are pretty common such as "Airport WiFi" or "Hotel
   WiFi" or "Guest" but are distinct networks with different WPA-PSK or
   are not using security at all ("open" networks).

   By using device location, client devices can avoid spurious

6.  Security Considerations

   The network authentication mechanism relies on an attacker's
   inability to obtain a signed certificate for the victim's domain
   name.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Extending WiFi QR Code

   This section is non-normative and merely explains how extending the
   WiFi QR code could work.  QR codes come with their own security
   risks, most signficant that an attacker can place their own QR code
   over a legitimate QR code.

   Several major smartphone operating systems support a QR code with the
   following format for the SSID "example" with WPA-PSK "password",

   WIFI:T:WPA;S:example;P:password;;

   This could be extended to add a field containing the fingerprint of
   the encrypted DNS server certificate.  As several DNS servers can be
   included in the QR code with "D:", each DNS server with its own
   certificate using [RFC8792] line folding,

   WIFI:T:WPA;S:example;P:password; \
