The UE uses a permanent key securely stored in the SIM to authenticate to the evolved packet core. \r\n\r\nThe attack in https://alter-attack.net/ says LTE is susceptible to DNS spoofing attack because of a malicious MitM relay between the UE and the eNodeB to manipulate the (encrypted) payload of user data transmissions (see page 8 in the above paper).
