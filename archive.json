The UE uses a permanent key securely stored in the SIM to authenticate to the evolved packet core. \r\n\r\nThe attack in https://alter-attack.net/ says LTE is susceptible to DNS spoofing attack because of a malicious MitM relay between the UE and the eNodeB to manipulate the (encrypted) payload of user data transmissions (see page 8 in the above paper).

      "body": "DDR is useful in deployments where the local network cannot be upgraded to host a encrypted resolver and the home router cannot be upgraded to support DNR.  For instance, DDR is typically used to discover the ISP's encrypted resolver or public encrypted resolver. In other words, DDR scope is restricted to encrypted resolvers using public IP addresses.  \r\n\r\nIn this case, the attack surface significantly reduces. The attacker does not have visibility into any DNS traffic. I am assuming in near future CDNs, sensitive domains and endpoints will move TLS 1.3 and ECH. \r\n\r\nWhat will the attacker do just with destination IP addresses ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Reason:  consider an enterprise with offices around the world, each using the same network name, e.g., \"cisco corporate\", as a good example.  No matter where you go in the world as an employee, that's the network you see.\r\n\r\nWhile Cisco IT chose 802.1X, some other enterprise or smaller-ish company with lots of offices (office supply store, pizza franchise, etc.) could choose to use WPA-PSK.  \r\n\r\nThe same SSID appears in all of those networks.  Some, yes, might have their own encrypted DNS server in the branch office, with its own identity.  Such a deployment would break our I-D, I would argue by design of our I-D.  I don't see a fix for that.\r\n\r\nAdding GPS means those branch offices with the same SSID are deigned to not work.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have more thoughts on using location, but I don't have them articulated well yet.  \r\n\r\nBasically:  it feels premature to add 'location'.
